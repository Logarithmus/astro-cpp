/// Lambert Problem
/**
 * This class represent a Lambert's problem. When instantiated it assumes a
 * prograde orbit (unless otherwise stated) and evaluates all the solutions up
 * to a maximum number of multiple revolutions. After the object is instantiated
 * the solutions can be retreived using the appropriate getters. Note that the
 * number of solutions will be N_max*2 + 1, where N_max is the maximum number of
 * revolutions.
 *
 * NOTE: The class has been tested extensively via monte carlo runs checked with
 * numerical propagation. Compared to the previous Lambert Solver in the
 * keplerian_toolbox it is 1.7 times faster (on average as defined by
 * lambert_test.cpp). With respect to Gooding algorithm it is 1.3 - 1.5 times
 * faster (zero revs - multi revs). The algorithm is described in detail in the
 * publication below and its original with the author.
